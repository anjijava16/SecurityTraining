# MEAN_stack

This is a SPA using Mongo / Express / Angular / Node

The code is largely stolen from "Write Modern Web Apps with the MEAN Stack" by Jeff Dickey
with some modifications to make it even more vulnerable.

It was built in VS2013 with Node.js Tools installed, but should port to any other IDE.
The project build process uses gulp  

The vagrant file maps this project folder to /vagrant on the VM.
The application appears at http://10.10.10.10/ . The VM uses host-only networking - a network that is private to your host and the guest machines on that host.
